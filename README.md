Hi! I'm a Software Engineer and believe it or not i'm not ðŸŒ  Bojack Horseman ðŸŒ  (damn you guy who got /bojackhorseman ðŸ˜©)

I currently work as a Full Stack Developer. 

Hopefully when I start working on my personal projects you will see repos about software related to web dev, computer graphics, videogames, ML, DL and hopefully contribute to some open source libraries.
