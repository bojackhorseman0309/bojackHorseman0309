### HELLOOOOOOO 🐴

I'm a Software Engineer and believe it or not i'm not 🌠  Bojack Horseman 0309 🌠 (damn you guy who got /bojackhorseman 😩)

I currently work as a Full Stack Developer. 

Hopefully when i start working on my personal projects you will see repos about software related to web dev, computer graphics, videogames, ML, DL and hpefully contribute to some open source libraries.

The repos that you are seeing now are old college stuff, everything good is private (i swear) lmao 😆.
